# Credits
A table-top Elemental Tower Defense Game inspired by all the Tower Defense (TD) games on Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos. Much of my child hood was spent playing that game all the mini-games that clever people made throughout the years. Besides my love of gaming, I wanted to make this game to further learn C# and how to utilize the programming language to do some pretty amazing things on the Unity Engine.
  Another reason I am working on this game is to learn about pathfinding algorithms like A-star and Greedy-Best-First-Search. I learned much of what I learned about pathfinding from Wilmer Lin's Udemy Series, "PathFinding in Unity". I used much of his code in this game to start to learn how I can use it to create a Fire Emblem type turn based strategy game in the future that would require much more manipulation of the algorithm. Wilmer Lin's "Assassin's GO Boardgame" series also helped me learn how to make a full game loop. Through the use of Itween I could make some simple animations for my towers and enemies.
  This project allowed me to create some of my first game art using Blender and Gimp.
